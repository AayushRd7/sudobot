# sudobot

With sudobot, you can run commands on your server from Telegram. *It's fast and simple, but might not be secure*.

To get started, edit the `bot.ini` file with your favourite text editor to use your bot token and user ID (not username).

You'll also need the latest version of python-telegram-bot installed:

    pip3 install python-telegram-bot

Then run the bot with `python3 bot.py`.
